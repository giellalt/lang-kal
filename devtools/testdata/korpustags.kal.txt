% The Document has two parts. 
% The first part outlines the internal structure of
% the complex POS, these should be built as boxes or panes.
% The last part is a list over the different morphosyntactic categories.

% The tags are in complementary distribution within each tag column.
% The derivation component is ignored.


% 1. Structure of the different POS

% Note!!! The tag grouping under this section is not up to date

% Tag syntax for the larger POS
% Not all combinations within each box are possibe.

% "-" indicates optionality. It is perhaps not needed. "|" means "OR".
% The Function: list is listed below, and not indicated here.

% The name of these boxes are now legible, rather than the tags (tags in parentheses?)
