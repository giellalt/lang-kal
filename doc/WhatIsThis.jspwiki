This is a grammatical analyser for Greenlandic.

Based upon a cooperation between Oqaasileriffik (Grønlands
sprogsekretariat) and Giellatekno, Oqaasileriffik has built
a full-sized Greenlandic analyser.

Central developers have been:
Per Langgård, Liv Molich, Nani Nilsen, Trond Trosterud, Paneeraq Nielsen,
Anna  Karina Madsen Beatrine Heilman and Sjur Moshagen.

It is in use in a Greenlandic spellchecker and in a set
of pedagogical programs for Greenlandic.
