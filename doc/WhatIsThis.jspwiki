This is a grammatical analyser for Greenlandic.

Based upon a cooperation between Oqaasileriffik (Gr√∏nlands
sprogsekretariat) and Giellatekno, Oqaasileriffik has built
a full-sized Greenlandic analyser.

It is in use in a Greenlandic spellchecker and in a set
of pedagogical programs for Greenlandic.
