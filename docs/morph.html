Morphophonology
===============

Suffixes fall into three categories, +, - and ±. The first type, the
plus type, is the plain agglutinative one, the suffix is just added to
the stem. The second type (-) tells that the suffix can only be added to
a vowel-final stem, so it removes an eventual final consonant from the
stem, and the third type (±) is stem-sensitive, so that it truncates the
final consonant from some stems, but not from others.

    up-decl      {±up}      {±it}     {+nut}
    irniq       ernerup    ernerit    ernernut

The p-variety stems all have a short fricative in the stem (v, s, l, j,
g, r), this one is lengthened in front of a consonantal minus suffix.

The p-variety stems are gradually shifted to both the p-declension and
the up-declension(?). For taliq + mi we have 3 different forms: tallimi
(tal(l)iq+mi) (correct), talimi (taliq+mi (regularized), talermi
(taliq+mi) ("wrong", but very often)

All the suffixes of the p-declension are minus-suffixes (they remove a
final consonant)

The suffixes of the up-declension are plus/minus-suffixes
